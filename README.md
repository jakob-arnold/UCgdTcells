This repository contains the code used for creating figures 1-2 and figures 4-7 in our manuscript. Files needed for the analysis can be downloaded from [insert download link]. This download link contains both the raw data (count matrices, meta data, etc.) and the processed R objects (as .Rds files). Raw data can be used to start from step 1 (1_process_code), R objects can be directly used for step 2 (2_figures_code).

Additionally, this repository contains the code used for mapping sequencing data from FLASH-seq experiments (0_PreProcess_code).s
