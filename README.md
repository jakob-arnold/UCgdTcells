This repository contains the code used for creating all scRNA-seq and flow cytometry plots in our manuscript. Files needed for the analysis can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1spydb-KdtWlo6SKx10gGe61IMQxeLs-5?usp=sharing). This download link contains both the raw data (count matrices, meta data, etc.) and the processed R objects (as .Rds files). Raw data can be used to start from step 1 (`/1_process_code`), R objects can be directly used for step 2 (`/2_figures_code`).
